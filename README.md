# FindDuplicate



To run Function, use the following in powershell

First create the function by executing the script.

Once the script has added the function to powershell use the following syntaxt
Find-Duplicates 'string'

It will return the solution to the problem either the duplicate letter or NO Duplicates Found.

Note:  I commented out my approach to testing the file, so you can see how I was able to verify that the file worked.
